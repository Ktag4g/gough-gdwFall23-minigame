Minigame for Game Design Workshop

Game Name: SpaceBud
Join Bearbud and rescue your crewmates on your crashing spaceship!

Controls: 
A and D or arrow keys to move
Hold Space to boost up

How to Play:
Avoid getting hit by asteroids
Collide into your crewmate bears to collect them
Collected crewmates line up behind you
If you are hit with an asteroid with a crewmate, that crewmate will replace your Bearbud and carry on
If you are hit with an asteroid with no crewmates left, its a Game Over! **RELOAD WEBPAGE TO  RESTART GAME**

Dev Log:
**Current Bug!**
Currently, if you have more than one crewmate and are hit with an asteroid the bears both move to player position and end up launching each other. This is being worked on! For the time being, keep one crewmate at a time

Game Features:
Movement: Player is connected to a central platform and can rotate around said platform, can also move vertically by holding and releasing space. Rotation is still 
    dictated around platform
Bear Collection: Colliding with a passing bear as a player will collect said bear, deleting it from where it was an having it form a line of bears behind you
Asteroid Avoidance: Objective is to avoid colliding with the asteroids. If a player does, the bear currently used as a player will be launched away and disapear  
    after a few seconds 
Crewmate Lives: The line af bears created from collecting bears function as extra lives. If a player gets hit with an asteroid and they have bears collected, the next bear in line will be taken from the line and become the player **currently bugged**
